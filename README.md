# Gate Information Display Simulator

> **Amateur hobby project.** This is a fan-made imitation of United Airlines gate screens, built from a few photos. It is not nearly as accurate as the real thing: layouts, colors, fonts, wording and boarding logic are all approximations. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to United Airlines or Star Alliance, and it must not be used for real airport operations or travel decisions. Always check the airline's official app or website for real flight information.

A static web app that looks like an airline boarding gate screen. It can pull live flight data (times, gate, aircraft, status) and lets you set the rest by hand: boarding groups, status, upgrade and standby lists, amenities, and promos.

It has no backend, so it runs on GitHub Pages.

- `index.html`: the display, a 1920x1080 layout scaled to fit any screen. Double-click or press `F` for fullscreen. `←` / `→` change the boarding group.
- `control.html`: the config and control page.
- `status.html`: a flight status page for the same flight.

## Running it

**Locally:** serve the folder over HTTP (so localStorage and fetch behave), for example:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/control.html
```

**GitHub Pages:** push the repo, then go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
Then open `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/control.html`.

## Live data

Flight data comes from [AeroDataBox](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox) on RapidAPI, called directly from the browser. Subscribe to the free tier and paste your RapidAPI key into the control page. The key is stored only in your browser's localStorage and is never committed.

- **By flight number:** looks up a flight number and date. For multi-leg flights, set the origin airport.
- **By airport / gate:** lists one airline's departures (default `UA`) from an airport for the next ~12 hours, optionally filtered by gate or destination, and shows the next one.
- **Manual only:** no API calls; you type everything in.

Auto-refresh re-pulls the selected flight every N minutes. If both the control page and the display are open, only one of them makes each request. Tick **Freeze details** to stop a refresh from overwriting your manual edits. The quick-delay buttons tick it for you.

The upgrade and standby lists and the boarding progress are not in any public API, so they are always entered by hand.

## United live data (one-click bookmark)

The control page has a **Send to gate display** button. Drag it to your bookmarks bar once. Then open any flight's details
page on [united.com Flight Status](https://www.united.com/en/us/flightstatus) and click the bookmark.

It runs inside your own united.com tab, calls the same JSON endpoints that page uses, and opens the control page with the
data. That covers nearly everything on the screen: live times and delay reason, gate, terminal, United's boarding time,
aircraft and tail, inbound flight, weather, amenities, and the upgrade/standby lists with capacity, booked and checked-in
counts. Nothing to install, and it works from the GitHub Pages site.

The bookmark from the GitHub Pages site only loads `js/united.js` from the site each time it's clicked, so it always
runs the latest code. Bookmarks dragged before this change carry an old copy of the code: drag the button again once.
A bookmark from a local copy (`localhost`) still carries the whole code, because united.com can't load scripts from
your own computer, so drag it again after pulling changes.

**Auto-refresh:** united.com's flight page never refreshes by itself. After you click the bookmark, the united.com tab
clicks the page's own "Refresh now" every 5 minutes and sends the new data to the control page. A small note in the
corner of the united.com page shows the last refresh and has a Stop link. Both tabs must stay open, but they can be in
the background. If Chrome's Memory Saver puts the united.com tab to sleep, the updates stop: add `united.com` under
Settings → Performance → "Always keep these sites active". Updates are skipped while **Freeze details** is ticked.
Click the bookmark again to refresh right away, or to reconnect after closing the control page.

The data only moves between your own browser tabs. Upgrade/standby names (surname + initial, as United shows them publicly)
stay in your browser's storage, are never committed, and are left out of "Copy link for another device" snapshots.
**Finding a flight without any API key:** open your airport's departures on FlightView and click the bookmark. The control
page then lists every departure (flight number, destination, gate, time) as a picker, with a filter box. Pick one and it
becomes the current flight, with the united.com link built for it; click the bookmark there for everything else.

**Next departure from the gate:** United's data doesn't include it, so the control page links to the airport's
departures on [FlightView](https://www.flightview.com/). Click the same bookmark there: it reads FlightView's departures
(with gates) and picks the next flight from your gate. AeroDataBox can also be used, but its free data often has no gates.

A tab opened by the bookmark hands its update to an already-open control page and closes itself.

## Optional: follow a gate automatically (local feed)

`server/gate_feed.py` keeps one gate up to date without any clicking, and rolls over to the next flight once one departs.
Each cycle it starts your Chrome off-screen, reads the airport's departures from FlightView's page, picks the flight
currently using the gate, then reads that flight's details from united.com, and serves the result on localhost.

```sh
pip install playwright
python server/gate_feed.py --airport EWR --gate C107        # --every 120 --airline UA --show
```

On the control page tick **Follow a gate with the local feed**. The display and status pages poll it, so a screen left
running follows the gate on its own. Same caveats as the bookmark: personal use, breaks when either site changes.
Passenger names never leave your machine.

## Wallpaper Engine

`wallpaper/` is a web wallpaper: copy the folder into Wallpaper Engine's `myprojects` directory (or open it from the
editor) and it shows the display full-screen behind your desktop. Its **Display link** setting takes any URL:

- the plain display URL, which stays live if the local feed is running;
- or a snapshot link from **Copy link for another device**, which pins one flight's settings.

Wallpaper Engine has its own browser storage, so the control page can't push changes into it directly; use the feed or a
new snapshot link.

## Flight status page

`status.html` shows the current flight like an airline status page: delay banner, departure/arrival with gates, aircraft and
inbound flight, weather, amenities, and the standby and upgrade lists. It uses the same shared state as the display.

## How the pages sync

Pages on the **same browser** share state through localStorage, so edits on `control.html` show up on the display right away (for example, a laptop driving a TV over HDMI).

For a **different device**, use **Copy link for another device**. It puts a snapshot of the current state in the URL. Later edits won't reach that device. You can optionally include the API key so the device keeps refreshing flight times on its own.

## Assets

- `assets/united-lockup.png` and `assets/star-alliance.png`: header logos (trimmed, resized, and the star lightened to white). They are trademarks of their owners and are used here only for this non-commercial fan project. **Logo image** on the control page overrides the whole header lockup.
- `assets/qr-assistance.png`: the "Need assistance?" QR code (links to United's travel help page), also used on the app promo. If it's missing, the Flight tab shows the estimated arrival instead.
- `assets/icons/united-sprite.svg`: United's icon sprite from united.com, used for amenities and labels.

Reference photos go in `ref/` (ignored by git). Colors and sizes are CSS variables at the top of `css/display.css`.
